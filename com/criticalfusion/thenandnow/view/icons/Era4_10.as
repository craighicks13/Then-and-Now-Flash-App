			description = "Automated Dairy Plant<br/><br/>Dairies today must be registered with the government or have a provincial license.  This registration or license says that the dairy meets safety and health requirements for making food products.  A dairy plant inspector inspects the dairies to ensure they are clean and safe. They also make sure that proper processes are used to make healthy dairy products. In today's automated dairy plants, milk is never exposed to air, light, or human hands. Milk is kept cold and stored in insulated silos, large containers used for storage, until it is processed and packaged.";
