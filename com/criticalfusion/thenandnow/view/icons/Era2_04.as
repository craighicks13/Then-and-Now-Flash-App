			description = "Early Milking Machine<br/><br/>The first milking machines were similar to a traditional milking pail. A milker fit on top of a regular milk pail and milker nipples sucked the milk from the cow’s udder. A large wide strap was put across the cow’s lower back. This allowed the cow to move around naturally when it was being milked. As electric power became more widely used, suction milking machines were used. These machines still had to be lifted and milk poured into milk cans. This had to be done several times for each cow.";
